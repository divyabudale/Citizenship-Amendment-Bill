# Citizenship-Ammendment-Bill

Objective : The purpose of this project was to study the impact of citizenship ammendment bill introduced in India in 2019

Motivation : The bill raised lots of questions, protests were held and the leaders were questioned. I wanted to do a sentiment analysis on twitter data with respect to the bill

Data : The data comes from Twitter and was extracted using tweepy. Due to limitation, only 10000 records were pulled out twitter.

Analysis and Results: The data was cleaned to remove special characters, stop words, punctuation, contractions were expanded, accented characters were removed. Sentiment was calculated using TextBlob. Word cloud was created based on the positive and negative sentiments and clear distinction was found in the words used to describe both. 
Word cloud was also created for the entire corpus and was masked on to the image of Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi's face
